Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as part of my journey in learning JavaScript and practicing DOM manipulation.

Indicates when a player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.<br>
